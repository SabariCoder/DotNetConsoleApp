/*
 C# is an object-oriented programming language. The four basic principles of object-oriented programming are:

1.Abstraction -Modeling the relevant attributes and interactions of entities as classes to define an abstract representation of a system.
2.Encapsulation - Hiding the internal state and functionality of an object and only allowing access through a public set of functions.
3.Inheritance - Ability to create new abstractions based on existing abstractions.
4.Polymorphism - Ability to implement inherited properties or methods in different ways across multiple abstractions.
